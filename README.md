Just an installer for LazyVim on Windows. For personal use. Haven't tested this yet, I hope it runs the next time I have to set this up on Windows.

Just tracking some minor items here:

- Creates an empty `config.yml` file to prevent lazygit from failing on initialization.
- Installs node via `nvm`.
- Zeroes out the padding of Windows Terminal for an edge-hugging Neovim experience.

Instructions (for future self):
- Run this as admin.
